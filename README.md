# foundry.dungeon
A Foundry VTT game system for the .dungeon TTRPG

## Development:

> Note : Any folder that contains a `.`-suffixed name should not be edited
> manually, as they are compiled from their respective non-`.`-suffixed folder.
> (Example: To edit a file in `/.langs`, edit the correct file in `/langs`).
> The **ONLY** exception to this is the `.vscode` folder which editing anything
> in it will almost definitely get your PR rejected until the changes are undone.
