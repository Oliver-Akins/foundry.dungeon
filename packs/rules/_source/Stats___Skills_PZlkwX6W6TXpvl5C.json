Add your bonus to Contests where the Skill is applicable, rolling your Stat Dice and adding the Skill to the result.</p><p></p><h2>Skill Training</h2><p>To learn a new skill, PCs must find someone who can teach it to them. This requires a payment of 20 Bytes and a week of downtime. To gain Expertise in a skill, the player and the Server Host must agree to a challenge. Failure to accomplish the challenge locks you out of the skill into another challenge is agreed upon. If the challenge is accomplished the player gains Expertise in the skill.</p><p></p><h2>Detailed Skill Breakdowns</h2><ul><li><p>@UUID[.hcU7kvIyJEyQfjZI]{Build Skills}</p></li><li><p>@UUID[.eEKc5g8nyJo4gzcA]{Meta Skills}</p></li><li><p>@UUID[.Bv7FKq69XgfNgq0G]{Presence Skills}</p></li><li><p>@UUID[.YjSClMTdT8psEy3k]{Hands Skills}</p></li></ul>"

Expertise allows you a unique \"stance\" with your weapon of choice. Whether you're swinging a sword or a punch, add your training when making attacks against against opponents.</p><p></p><h2>Platforming</h2><p>Acrobatic leaps, climbing, and navigating dangerous terrain. Training in platforming gives you tighter control over your Avatar's movements. Expertise gives you a double jump.</p><p></p><h2>Strength</h2><p>Knocking this over, pushing things out of the way, and general, hand-made destruction.
